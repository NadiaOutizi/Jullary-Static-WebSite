    <h2>Why jullary?</h2>
   <pre>
    Jewellery is often viewed as a fashion accessory for completing an outfit. For many,
     a look is not complete until the right accessories are added. A "classic" look, for instance, 
     demands pearls and diamonds for completion.

    Jewellery has played an important role in human life for thousands of years.
     We learn from history that ancient civilisations appreciated jewellery and it 
     was used to highlight the natural beauty of its wearers. Different pieces were worn to symbolise 
    different messages such as security, wisdom, elegance, and prosperity.</pre>
